    "<p><strong>Machine Learning: <br></strong>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. These algorithms are use to find the pattern in data, and by using this information computer will able to predict new data or trande of data. Machine learning involves a range of techniques and approaches, all aimed at allowing computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>"

    "        <li><strong>Regression</strong>:Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., linear regression, polynomial regression). Regression can be simple lineat regression and multiple linear regression. Here the term regression means the relation in between variables.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Classification</strong>:By this technique we try to classify the outcome based on input features. Like we have to predict if their is any defect in product and the outcome will we ither yes or no. Classification can be binary class classifiation and multi-class classification. Some algorithms used in supervised learning are (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, neural networks).</li>\n",
